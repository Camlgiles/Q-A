# [Q&A](https://q-and-a-clone.herokuapp.com/)

Q&A is a question and answer forum inspired by Quora. Q&A allows users to ask questions on an open forum where other users can then answer their questions. Q&A was built with a Ruby on Rails backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React with a Redux framework on the frontend.
